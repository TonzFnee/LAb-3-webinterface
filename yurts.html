        <h2>The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>What is a yurt?</strong> - Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</li>

            <li><strong>How are the yurts furnished?</strong> - Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with a down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</li>

            <li><strong>What should I bring?</strong> - Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It is also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</li>
